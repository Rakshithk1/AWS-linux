## This project is about creating and deleting S3 bucket.
	##Here we are using just CLI to create and delete the bucket




	**Firs you will have to create an IAM role**
	  Then go to the IAM users dashboard and click on security
	  There you will have to create the access keys and select for CLI
	  Once it is done, save the access keys and security keys, so that you can be able to login to the CLI

	**Now open Mobaxterm or Putty and enter the cmd as
		aws configure	
		##here you will get an options to enter the access key and security key, and also enter the region and enter any name
		Once this is done, Enter the cmd to confirm if you are logged into the user.
			aws sts get-caller-identity							##sts --- This stands for Security Token Service, which is used for identity verification.
													##get-caller-identity --- This specific command retrieves details about the IAM user or role

			Now this means you are logged in
			You can check by using cmds like " aws s3 ls or aws ec2 ls			##this cmd is used to display the s3 and ec2 if present
			To create the s3 bucket you will have to enter this cmd
				aws s3 mb s3://bucket_name						##mb refers to make bucket
			Once the s3 is created you can check using aws s3 ls or access s3 in site
			To add the file to the s3
				aws s3 cp /file_in_your_system bucket_name/ 				##the file will be added to the bucket
			To remove the file and bucket you can use
				aws s3 rm s3://bucket/filename
				aws s3 -rvf s3://bucket							##this will remove the bucket and file
