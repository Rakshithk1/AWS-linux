##Setup and configuration of Auto Scaling in AWS to automatically scale EC2 instances based on CPU utilization. The project includes creating an Auto Scaling group, launch template, and testing with simulated CPU load to trigger scaling actions



	**First we have to create an Launch templete
		Go to EC2 and select Launch templete
		Select the details which you need for the instance

	  Once the Template is created, click on Autoscaling group
	   	Click on create auto scaling group
		Choose the launch templete you created
		You can choose any VPC and subnet
		You can use any security group or create it
		Set the scaling policies as you desire
		define the scaling actions to increase or decrease the number of instances based on CPU load

	  Once this is set, you can see an instance would be created and it would be running.
	  You can stop the instance and another instance would be created automatically. Which will prevent the down time
	  You can also increase the load of the CPU by accessing the instance via SSH and entering the forloop
	  	for i in {1..4}; do yes > /dev/null & done
	  Once this is done, you can see that 2 EC2 instances would be created which will distribute the load
